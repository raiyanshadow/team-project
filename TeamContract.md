### c) Attendance & Participation
* Members will attend all scheduled classes and team meetings unless illness, emergencies, or unavoidable conflicts occur.
* If unable to attend, a member must notify the team in advance and provide input asynchronously.
* During labs, meetings, or online discussions, every member is expected to:
    - Contribute ideas and feedback.

## 3. Decision Making

* Decisions will be made by consensus whenever possible.

* Major project changes (e.g., topic, structure, or coding framework) will be discussed collectively before implementation.
* Every member’s opinion will be valued, and decisions will be documented in writing (e.g., via group chat or meeting notes).

## 4. Conflict Resolution

* If a conflict arises, teammates will first:
    - Discuss the issue privately and respectfully.
    - Listen to each other’s perspectives and identify the root cause.
    - Attempt to find a compromise or blended solution that benefits the project.
* If the issue persists or affects progress:
    - The team will involve a TA or instructor as a neutral mediator.

    - Completing their assigned work on time and to a high standard.
    - Communicating early if they encounter difficulties or delays.
    - Participating actively in discussions and reviews.
    - Commenting code clearly to aid team understanding.
* Persistent non-participation or failure to meet expectations may result in lower peer evaluation scores.
