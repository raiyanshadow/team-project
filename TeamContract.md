# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* Which platform will you use for communication outside of class, when required for work on your course project? (Examples: Text message, Discord, WeChat, etc.)
  * We will use Instagram as our primary communication channel.

* Each teammate agrees to respond to messages in at most how long? 1 day? 2 days? Some other amount of time? 
  * Team members will respond to messages within 1 day.

* What things should a teammate notify you about? (Examples: if they think they won't be able to meet a deadline, if they have to miss lecture, etc.)
  * Team members should notify others when they cannot meet a deadline, if they have to miss lab, if they notice bugs in others' code, or if they have made a pull request and require others to check it.

* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. What are some respectful and inclusive behaviours you expect when communicating with each other during lectures, labs, or outside of class? (Examples: Actively listening to each team members ideas, giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute, etc.)
  * For smooth and productive communication, members should be understanding of other people's skill level, actively listening to each team member's ideas, and giving everyone a chance to speak.

    - some examples of possible additional team norms and expectations are included in the sample team contract in case your team needs some help getting ideas for what else you want to include.

## Decision Making

* How will decisions about your team project be made? (Examples: By majority vote, by unanimous vote, etc.)
  * Decisions will be made by consensus when possible. When this is not possible, decisions will be made by majority vote. 

---
## Conflict resolution

* How will your team resolve conflicts? (Example: by listening to each other's side of the issue and attempting to reach a compromise. By consulting a TA or instructor as a team, if a resolution has not yet been reached.)
  * If a conflict arises, teammates should discuss privately and attempt to reach a compromise or find a solution that incorporates the best of both party's ideas.

## Accountability

* Reliability and accountability are also important aspects of teamwork. What are the responsibilities of each team member? (Example: completing their share of the work in a timely manner, seeking assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required, etc.)
  * Each team member should complete their share of work.
  * Each team member should contribute equally to the team's goal.
